# Customer Churn Prediction 🚀

**A machine learning project to predict customer churn, designed to help businesses retain valuable customers and reduce revenue loss.**

---

## 🔥 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using machine learning. By leveraging a combination of **FastAPI** for model deployment and **Streamlit** for user-friendly interaction, businesses can make data-driven decisions to retain their most valuable customers.

- **Business Use Case**: Predicting customer churn to prevent revenue loss.
- **Technologies**: Python, pandas, FastAPI, Streamlit.
- **Deployment**: Fully deployed using FastAPI (backend) and Streamlit (frontend).

---

## 📈 Features

- **Real-time Churn Prediction**: Input customer data and get instant predictions.
- **User Interface**: A clean, intuitive **Streamlit app** for easy user interaction.
- **API Deployment**: Built with **FastAPI** for efficient, scalable predictions.
- **Visualization**: Data visualization of feature importance and performance metrics.

## 🎯 Key Results

- **Accuracy**: 80%
- **Precision**: 80%
- **Recall**: 1%
- **AUC**: 85%

These results were achieved after testing and optimizing multiple models, with **XGBoost** providing the best performance. 

**Note**: The low recall indicates that further work is needed to improve the identification of churned customers.
